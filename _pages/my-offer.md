A **computer vision** software engineer with **over 3 years of experience**

I have maintained, developed and launched [multiple projects](), carrying the development of its' algorithm and API codebases.

My current toolset includes
- Python
	- Tensorflow
	- Scikit-Learn
	- Point Cloud Library
	- OpenCV
- C++
	- Armadillo
	- Eigen
	- mlpack
	- OpenCV
- R
- Matlab

and all the other various framworks, libraries and technologies related to them.

## I can help you with all the sides of your project
- deep learning solutions, including feature detection, feature extraction, object detection, object recognition, object tracking and image segmentation.
- image processing algorithms, including image matching, filtering, space/time domain analysis, morphology, ranging and depth, etc.
- point cloud processing, including feature estimation, point cloud registration, surface reconstruction, 3D perception.
- statistical optimization, including EM algorithm, Monto Carlo method, reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithm.
- data cleaning, data preprocessing, and data visualization.

*Call me a Swiss Army Knife in terms of computer vision.*

## Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer
To inspire a cutting-edge vision algorithm, I have some skills includes
- Numerical Analysis, including matrix analysis, spectral analysis, convex optimization, FFT, etc.
- Algorithms, including data structure, graph theory, combinatorics, computational geometry.
- Statistics and Probability, including rsegression, Bayesian theory, time series, reliability analysis, etc.
- Mathematics, including differential equation, geometry, algebra, vector calculus, etc.

**I also experience in developing a complete AOI process.**
A complete vision algorithm should start from camera calibration.  To ensure that everytime the data is clean when we recieve, the process flow in every stop becomes quite important.
It consists:
- camera calibration.
- focus stacking.
- auto lighting.
- image compression and transmission.
- image preprocessing, including denoising, filtering, enhancement.
