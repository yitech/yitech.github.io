## <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Computer Vision Engineering

  <p>
    <strong>I specialize in applications written in both React and Angular.</strong>
    Recently I became also a huge fan of
    <a href="https://jtom.me/talks/make-your-components-pure-and-dumb-and-composable.pdf" target="_blank">one-way data flow</a>
    and
    <a href="https://medium.com/@jtomaszewski/handling-asynchronous-actions-in-redux-86724ed87c6c" target="_blank">Redux-like</a>
    architecture and also typed languages, e.g.
    <a href="https://medium.com/@jtomaszewski/why-typescript-is-the-best-way-to-write-front-end-in-2019-feb855f9b164" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My current experience and skills in front-end includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      lead TypeScript/JavaScript development: bootstraping, refactoring,
      improving the structure, reliability, build setup;
    </li>
    <li>
      full integration of front-end development using tools like
      <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" rel="nofollow">Webpack</a> with features
      like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments
      support, CI/CD, Storybook components library, automated testing of
      accessibility, server-side render and visual snapshots,
    </li>
    <li>
      good sense of design and UX,
    </li>
    <li>
      huge experience in almost all of the JS ecosystems, by having used in the
      past many libraries like Next.js, React, Redux, Redux-Observable, RxJS,
      Angular, Ionic Framework, Backbone, jQuery, Lodash/Underscore and many
      else.
    </li>
    <!-- <li>
      ... and even <strong>mobile app  development</strong> with the use of <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" rel="nofollow">Ionic Framework</a>.
      <br>
       With these, I can build a fully working native application for iOS and Android (both at once!) in Javascript in less than month.
       <br>
       <strong>You can already find some of my mobile applications in <a href="/portfolio/">my portfolio</a>.</strong>
    </li> -->
  </ul>

    Back-end Engineering
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>In back-end development, my current stack involves
      <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Elixir</a> and
      <a href="http://phoenixframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Phoenix Framework</a></strong>, and alternatively
    <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" rel="nofollow">Ruby on Rails</a> or
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">NodeJS</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nearly every app I have launched in the past had the back-end done also by
    me. In order to improve the development speed, performance and reliability,
    I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple times, from PHP to
    Ruby and now to Elixir; and configured servers using just the shell, then
    Chef/Ansible, and now Docker and Kubernetes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lessons I learned while doing all these apps will be useful for me
    forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I can do for you at that side is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      lead development of backends in Elixir/Ruby,
    </li>
    <li>
      splitting the back-end into separate domains and microservices,
    </li>
    <li>
      cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers,
      asynchronous workers,
    </li>
    <li>
      using different types of databases (like
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a>,
      <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQL</a>,
      <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch</a>,
      <a href="http://redis.io/" rel="nofollow">Redis</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      dividing the servers into different machine nodes / docker containers;
      database sharding; load balancing,
    </li>
    <li>
      refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility,
      separating concerns into separate functions/classes/modules, taking the
      business logic out from your request/response layer into separate modules
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" rel="nofollow">DDD</a>), and moving the app architecture into an event-based one
    </li>
    <li>
      writing unit and e2e tests
    </li>
  </ul>

    What about dev-ops, design, UI, project leadership, team mentorship ?
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>During my time I have created and released tens of websites.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end codebases, but
    often I also had to care about other things needed in a successful web
    application project:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      good planning of UI and thinking how it affects the UX;
    </li>
    <li>
      consistency in design and typography;
    </li>
    <li>
      Search Engine Optimization;
    </li>
    <li>
      launching, deployment and monitoring the app after the release;
    </li>
    <li>
      recruiting, onboarding and mentoring team members;
    </li>
    <li>
      in cases where a good Project Manager was missing, fullfilling his role,
      in order to save the project from losing time on unneeded things.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your initial thought is that I can’t be the best in everything, it's
    okay. Send the design job to someone else, and I will take care of all the
    code development, or whatever other role you see me best in.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cases when you already have an existing team, but you would still use
    some help, <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> as well.
    I’ll fit in very quickly, I promise.
